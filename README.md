# Sales_Forecasting_using_Marketing_Spend-Data
## Domain Analysis
- **TV:** Amount spent on TV advertisement.
- **Radio:** Amount spent on Radio.
- **Newspaper:** Amount spent on Newspaper.
- **Sales:** Sales of the product.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Loading and Basic Checks:** 
    - Loading the dataset and performing basic checks such as viewing the first and last few rows, summary statistics, and checking for missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Analyzing the distribution of marketing expenditures on each channel and their relationship with sales through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
3. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**
    - Handling outliers,  feature selection.
4. **Model Creation:**
    - Splitting the data into training and testing sets, creating a linear regression model, training the model, and making predictions.
5. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluating the model performance using various metrics such as R-squared score, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and mean absolute error.

## Steps Taken
1. Identified and analyzed the distribution of marketing expenditures on TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
2. Explored the relationship between marketing expenditures and sales through visualization.
3. Handled outliers and performed feature selection.
4. Created a linear regression model to predict sales based on marketing expenditures.
5. Evaluated the model performance using various metrics.

## Results
- The model achieved an R-squared score of [0.9085], indicating [insert interpretation of the score].


## Conclusion
- The analysis suggests that expenditure on TV advertisements has a stronger correlation with sales compared to radio and newspaper advertisements.
- Further optimizations or model improvements could be explored to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Note
- The project intentionally skips certain steps like feature scaling and transformation, as they are not be necessary for this specific analysis.
